# Stop Watch Task

## Explanation
   - Material UI: for styling
   - TypeScript
   - React-Toastify: For showing the toast messages for immediate feedback.
   - Modular Component Architecture

Here, I've used custom hooks to manage the stopwatch state individually.

```
useState- for storing time and running state
useRef- for storing the interval ID
useEffect - for managing starting and stopping the interval

useMemo- for managing the theme updation


```

### Small Addition
- Dark/Light Theme
- Responsive Grid Layout
- Toast Messages for addition and deletation of stopwatch
